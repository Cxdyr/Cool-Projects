This is a peice of code I wrote over the course of about 2 days that took a few hours and uses data structures to simulate
the process of a lab designing cards, sending these designs to a factory, choosing which card designs to make into cards based on the demand 
of a population, then sending these made cards to a store and selling them while tracking the profit of factory, store, and lists of card designs, and cards.


I wrote this code on 5/6/23.
