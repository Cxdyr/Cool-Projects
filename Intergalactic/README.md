This project is a freelance project that I worked on during my spring break, it took me about 3 hours to make and is pretty cool.
It simulates a ship carrying the last of the human race exploring space flying towards a wormhole that carries them to a new
galaxy with possible viable planets to survive on. It uses a list of crew that belong to the ship, and a few other things that 
are fairly basic.
